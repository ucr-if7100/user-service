#### `DATABASE_URL`\*

The URL of the MySQL database to which the API will connect. It should follow the following format and replace the corresponding values: `jdbc:mysql://{db_host}:{db_port:3306}/{db_name}`

#### `DATABASE_USERNAME`\*

The username used to authenticate the database connection.

#### `DATABASE_PASSWORD`\*

The password used to authenticate the database connection.
 
#### `PORT`

The port on which the server will run. By default, it uses port `8085`.

#### `SHOW_SQL`

Indicates whether Hibernate should display the SQL queries generated in the console. By default, it uses the value `false`.
